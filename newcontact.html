                        The short answer is no, however APMEX does reserve the right to request a 10% deposit on orders deemed "significant" by APMEX, before we will accept the order and lock in prices. On orders greater than $500,000.00, we recommend that you contact our Sales
                        Department at (800) 375-9006 Option 1 to determine if a deposit will apply.

                        Once we have issued a confirmation number, all prices are locked-in whether buying from us or selling to us. It is not our intention to enter into buying and/or selling transactions, accepting the risks involved only to have them cancelled. However, we
                        realize rare situations happen where orders need to be cancelled. Should you elect to cancel and/or offset your order, you must do so during normal business hours of 9:00 – 5:00 EST Monday – Friday. All cancellations are subject
                        to our Market Loss Policy plus a $35.00 (USD) cancellation fee. Cancellations may only be approved over the telephone, at which time you will be given a cancellation number. At that time, if any market loss to APMEX has occurred,
                        it will be calculated and added to the $35.00 (USD) cancellation fee. If applicable, any cancellation fee and/or market loss will be charged to your credit card for the full amount due, as per User Agreement. No future orders may
                        be permitted until any market loss is paid in full. Any market gain on cancellations shall remain the property of APMEX.

                        Yes. We hold all forms of check payments for 4 business days. The holding period ensures the bank has the opportunity to notify us of a problem with the payment before the order ships. Additional holding days may be added if your bank delays confirmation
                        of your check payment. To avoid the payment holding period and realize our cash discount, you may consider paying by same day bank wire.

                        APMEX generally packages and ships your order the following way (applies to domestic orders only):
                        <ul>
                            <li>Credit Card, Bank Wire and PayPal Orders (containing Pre-33 Gold or Jewelry) - Ship within 2 business days following the date of confirmed payment.</li>
                            <li>Credit Card, Bank Wire and PayPal Orders (not containing Pre-33 Gold or Jewelry) - Ship within 1 business day* following the date of confirmed payment.</li>
                            <li>All Personal Check and eCheck Orders - Ship after a 4 business day holding period to verify funds. Additional holding days may be added if your bank delays confirmation of your check payment. Due to an increase in fraudulent
                                activity, we no longer view bank/certified/cashier’s checks or money orders to be “as good as cash”. They are now also held for verification of funds.</li>

                        either place it on back order, attempt to locate another or a refund will be given. Should the value of your items decrease in that time period, you will not be entitled to any market gain.

                        questionable, suspicious or of significant risk to APMEX regardless of payment method and price confirmation. You must ensure that your payment is dated within 24 hours and received by APMEX within five business days on orders
                        under $25,000.00 (USD) and three business days on orders more than $25,000.00 (USD) to guarantee your price. Providing us with your credit card information is required to lock in pricing all orders. You are responsible to cover

                        are subject to our Market Loss Policy plus a $35.00 (USD) cancellation fee. Cancellations may only be approved over the telephone, at which time you will be given a cancellation number. At that time, if any market loss to APMEX
                        has occurred, it will be calculated and added to the $35.00 (USD) cancellation fee. If applicable, you may elect to pay any market loss by credit card at that time or, we will invoice you in which you will have thirty days to pay
                        the amount due in full. No future orders may be permitted until any market loss is paid in full. Any market gain on cancellations shall remain the property of APMEX.

                    <p>
                        Yes. If you have an existing IRA or 401(k), the easiest way to set up a new Precious Metal IRA is by transfer. You transfer the amount you want to invest in a new IRA, and there are no tax penalties. Your IRA custodian knows exactly how to do this and
                        will facilitate the process.

                    <p>
                        ETFs, or exchange traded funds, are most popular with traders and investors who need to quickly move in and out of markets. Physical metals are favored by those who buy and hold. If you own the physical metal you always have the option of taking physical
                        possession of the actual metal, while an ETF is a paper instrument with counterparty risks.

                        on their tax returns. If you have additional questions, please consult a tax professional for details on your specific tax situation.

                    <p>
                        Should you elect to return an item from your order, you must do so during normal business hours of 9 p.m. – 5 p.m. (ET) Monday – Friday. All returns must be done over the telephone only, at which time you will be given a Return Authorization Number. Once

                    <h3>Are there risks?</h3>
                    <p>
                        All investments involve risk - coins and bullion are no exception. The value of a bullion coin (e.g., American Eagles or Canadian Maple Leafs) is affected by many economic factors, including the current market price of bullion the perceived scarcity of
                        the coins and other factors. Some of these factors include the quality and current demand and general market sentiment. Therefore, because both bullion and coins can go down as well as up in value, investing in them may not be
                        suitable for everyone. Since all investments, including bullion and coins, can decline in value, you should understand them well, and have adequate cash reserves and disposable income before considering a bullion or coin investment.
