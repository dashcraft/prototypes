  <div class="article-group" id="cancelOrder">
    <h3>Can I cancel my order?</h3>
    <p>
      Once we have issued a confirmation number, all prices are locked-in whether buying from us or selling to us. It is not our intention to enter into buying and/or selling transactions, accepting the risks involved only to have them cancelled. However, we realize rare situations happen where orders need to be cancelled. Should you elect to cancel and/or offset your order, you must do so during normal business hours of 9:00 – 5:00 EST Monday – Friday. All cancellations are subject to our Market Loss Policy plus a $35.00 (USD) cancellation fee. Cancellations may only be approved over the telephone, at which time you will be given a cancellation number. At that time, if any market loss to APMEX has occurred, it will be calculated and added to the $35.00 (USD) cancellation fee. If applicable, any cancellation fee and/or market loss will be charged to your credit card for the full amount due, as per User Agreement. No future orders may be permitted until any market loss is paid in full. Any market gain on cancellations shall remain the property of APMEX.
