    <dt>Platinum:</dt>
    <dd>A chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol Pt and atomic number 78. A heavy, malleable, ductile, precious, gray-white transition metal, Platinum is resistant to corrosion and occurs in some nickel and copper ores along with some
        native deposits. Platinum is used in jewelry, laboratory equipment, electrical contacts, dentistry and automobile emissions control devices. Platinum coins and bars are now very popular investments.</dd>
    <dt>Platinum American Eagle:</dt>
    <dd>These are modern Platinum bullion coins minted by the U.S. Mint. These coins were first released in 1997; they are made of .9995 Platinum and were struck in 1 oz, 1/2 oz, 1/4 oz and 1/10 oz sizes.</dd>

        officially produced by a government mint and they are usually not legal tender. Government mints pick one date as the "restrike date" for a particular coin. For instance, the restrike date for the Austrian 100 Corona is 1915. Restrikes are considered
        bullion coins because such a large number are made that they have no numismatic value. In fact, the original coins made from the dies used for restrikes have no numismatic value because there is no way to tell them apart from the restrikes.</dd>
