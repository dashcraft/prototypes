    <h3>Can I have more than one IRA?</h3>

    <h3>Can I transfer money from an existing IRA account to fund my Precious Metal IRA, without incurring any tax penalties?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. If you have an existing IRA or 401(k), the easiest way to set up a new Precious Metal IRA is by transfer. You transfer the amount you want to invest in a new IRA, and there are no tax penalties. Your IRA custodian knows exactly how to do this and will facilitate the process.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="article-group" id="eligible">
    <h3>What types of IRAs are eligible to transfer or roll over?</h3>
    <p>
      All IRAs (Traditional IRA, Roth IRA, SEP IRA, SIMPLE IRA, Solo) are eligible for direct roll over. Ask your IRA custodian for details or any limitations.

    <h3>What is the difference between investing in a Precious Metal IRA and owning a Precious Metal ETF?</h3>
    <p>
      ETFs, or exchange traded funds, are most popular with traders and investors who need to quickly move in and out of markets. Physical metals are favored by those who buy and hold. If you own the physical metal you always have the option of taking physical possession of the actual metal, while an ETF is a paper instrument with counterparty risks.

    <h3>TWO WAYS TO INVEST</h3>
    <p>
      With APMEX, there are two ways to own Precious Metals:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>BUY – HOLD (Buy, Take Delivery, or Use Secure Storage)</li>
      <li>SELF-DIRECTED IRA (Use Retirement Funds, Metals Held in a Depository on Your Behalf)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="article-group" id="selfDirected">
    <h3>WHAT IS A SELF-DIRECTED IRA?</h3>
    <p>
      A self-directed IRA is an IRA that allows non-traditional assets such as Precious Metals to be held as the investment:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Some brokerage companies may allow for a self-directed option, but may not allow alternative investments like physical metals.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="article-group" id="whyConsider">
    <h3>WHY CONSIDER IT?</h3>
    <p>
      Precious Metals in a self-directed IRA:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Allow you to strategically balance your portfolio— perhaps the best option for the individual investor.</li>
      <li>May help to create a balanced portfolio, due to Gold’s negative correlation.</li>
      <li>Provide what many consider the fourth asset class (Gold), working in conjunction with traditional stocks, bonds and cash.</li>
      <li>Help your portfolio achieve what many analysts recommend— a 4-12% allocation in Gold and Silver.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="article-group" id="advantages">
    <h3>ADVANTAGES</h3>
    <p>
      A self-directed IRA provides:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>All the benefits of other IRAs.</li>
      <li>Alternative investments in assets such as Precious Metals that other IRAs do not allow.</li>
      <li>The owner control of their IRA.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="article-group" id="preciousMetalTypes">
    <h3>PRECIOUS METAL TYPES</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bullion:</strong> Value of the Coin, Bar or Round is based solely on the metal content.</li>
      <li><strong>Semi-Numismatic:</strong> Coins that have value based on both their metal content and their potential collectible value.</li>
      <li><strong>Numismatic:</strong> Coins with prices that depend more on factors such as rarity, condition, dates and mint marks than on their Precious Metal content.</li>
