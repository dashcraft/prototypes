  <div class="article-group" id="risks">
    <h3>Are there risks?</h3>
    <p>
      All investments involve risk - coins and bullion are no exception. The value of a bullion coin (e.g., American Eagles or Canadian Maple Leafs) is affected by many economic factors, including the current market price of bullion the perceived scarcity of the coins and other factors. Some of these factors include the quality and current demand and general market sentiment. Therefore, because both bullion and coins can go down as well as up in value, investing in them may not be suitable for everyone. Since all investments, including bullion and coins, can decline in value, you should understand them well, and have adequate cash reserves and disposable income before considering a bullion or coin investment.

Jewelry items and non-Precious Metal products (such as coin tubes and other supplies) are taxed if shipped within Oklahoma. For Oklahoma customers, these taxable items are clearly designated at checkout with a Taxable subtotal for the customer’s reference. A Non-Taxable Subtotal is also shown for items that are not taxed.
