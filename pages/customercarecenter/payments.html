  <div class="article-group" id="discount">
    <h3>Is there a discount for paying by Check or Wire?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. We provide a 4.0% cash discount off our list/retail price to our customers if they pay for their orders by check, bank wire, or trade. The prices shown for each product on the website include the 4.0% cash discount unless you choose to pay by credit card or PayPal.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="article-group" id="formOfPayment">
    <h3>What form of payment does APMEX accept?</h3>
    <p>
      Payment to APMEX must be provided using one of the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Credit card</li>
      <li>PayPal</li>
      <li>Bank Wire</li>
      <li>eCheck</li>
      <li>Personal check</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="article-group" id="holding">
    <h3>Do you have a holding period for checks?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. We hold all forms of check payments for 4 business days. The holding period ensures the bank has the opportunity to notify us of a problem with the payment before the order ships. Additional holding days may be added if your bank delays confirmation of your check payment. To avoid the payment holding period and realize our cash discount, you may consider paying by same day bank wire.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="article-group" id="eCheck">
    <h3>How do I qualify for eCheck payments?</h3>
    <p>
      If you have purchased from us previously and have paid with a personal check, we can make you e-check payment eligible. Simply contact us for assistance if you don’t see this payment option in checkout. If you have not yet purchased by check but want to become eCheck payment eligible, consider paying for your next order or two by personal check, then contact us so we can update your account to allow eCheck payments.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="article-group" id="wireFunds">
    <h3>Where and how do I wire funds?</h3>
    <p>
      Upon placing an order and our issuing a confirmation number, we will provide you instructions along with our bank name, ABA routing number and account number. Please be advised we can only process same-day bank wires, and your bank will likely charge you a fee of $20 to $45 to issue the wire, depending on your bank’s processing fees schedule.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="article-group" id="goodFunds">
    <h3>What is your good funds policy?</h3>
    <p>
      Funds are considered “good” 4 business days from the day we receive your personal check or eCheck. Additional holding days may be added if your bank delays confirmation of your check payment. To realize the cash discount and avoid waiting for check funds to be good, you may consider paying by same day bank wire. Those funds are considered good upon receipt. eCheck payments eliminate the need to mail a payment, but are still held for verification of funds.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="article-group" id="needPayment">
    <h3>How quickly will you need my payment?</h3>
    <p>
    You must ensure that your payment is received by APMEX within (5) five business days on orders under $25,000 (USD) and (3) three business days on orders more than $25,000 (USD) to guarantee your price. APMEX reserves the right to cancel orders that do not meet this requirement. We recommend mailing your payment the same day your order is placed and using 2-3 day priority mail through the United States Postal Service to be sure your payment is received on time.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="article-group" id="creditCards">
    <h3>Do you accept credit cards?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. We accept both Visa and MasterCard credit cards for payment. They are convenient for paying for smaller orders. Credit card orders exceeding $5,000 (USD) are not accepted until you are an established customer. All credit card orders are reviewed on an order by order basis. In addition, we will only ship to the credit card billing address. Please confirm that the ship to address is the same as the mailing address in your online account before placing credit card orders. We reserve the right to refuse any order deemed questionable or of significant risk to APMEX regardless of payment method and price confirmation.

    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="article-group" id="payPal">
    <h3>Do you accept PayPal?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, we do accept PayPal for Payment. PayPal orders exceeding $5,000 (USD) are not accepted until you are an established customer. PayPal orders exceeding $10,000 (USD) are not accepted. PayPal is only available for orders shipped to a valid U.S. address and for US Dollar (USD) transactions only.

    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="article-group" id="onlinePayments">
    <h3>Do you accept ACH or online payments?</h3>
    <p>
      No, we do not accept ACH transactions. We do accept online bill payments in check form only and they will be subject to the same payment holding time as other checks. We will ship the order 4 business days after we receive the bill payment check.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="article-group" id="paymentUnreceived">
    <h3>What happens if my payment isn't received within the applicable time period?</h3>
    <p>
      It's always best to send us your payment immediately to ensure APMEX can honor the confirmed price. If payment is not received within five business days for orders under $25,000 (USD) and three business days for orders more than $25,000 (USD), APMEX reserves the right to either, accept your payment, refuse and cancel your order, or provide a fresh quote based on the market price at the time we received payment.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="article-group" id="followUp">
    <h3>What happens if I don't send a check or follow up on my order after it has been confirmed?</h3>
    <p>
      Your order may be cancelled if we do not receive payment within the required time period. Also, your account may be closed and you may no longer be able to place trades with us. If a decline in the market price occurs, you will be liable for any market loss we incur for locking in and accepting your order. (Our Market Loss Policy). You will be charged the difference between your confirmed price and the market buy price when your order is officially cancelled. Any market gain on cancellations shall remain the property of APMEX.

    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="article-group" id="cancelOrder">
    <h3>Can I cancel my order?</h3>
    <p>
      Once we have issued a confirmation number, all prices are locked-in whether buying from us or selling to us. It is not our intention to enter into buying and/or selling transactions, accepting the risks involved only to have them cancelled. However, we realize rare situations happen where orders need to be cancelled. Should you elect to cancel and/or offset your order, you must do so during normal business hours of 9 a.m. – 5 p.m. (ET) Monday – Friday. All cancellations are subject to our Market Loss Policy plus a $35.00 (USD) cancellation fee. Cancellations may only be approved over the telephone.  At that time, if any market loss to APMEX has occurred, it will be calculated and added to the $35.00 (USD) cancellation fee. If applicable, you may elect to pay any market loss by credit card at that time or, we will invoice you in which you will have thirty days to pay the amount due in full. No future orders may be permitted until any market loss is paid in full. Any market gain on cancellations shall remain the property of APMEX.
