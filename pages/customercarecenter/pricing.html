    <h3>Do you add a commission fee to your posted prices?</h3>
    <p>
      No. The prices you see are the prices you pay. The only charges APMEX adds are for shipping, handling and insurance. Shipping is free on all domestic orders over $99.00 (USD), and on all Citadel orders.

  <div class="article-group" id="priceLock">
    <h3>Are my prices locked in when I place my order?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. When you place an order over the telephone or online, we will send you an order confirmation email detailing what you purchased as well as your locked prices.

  <div class="article-group" id="priceLockLength">
    <h3>How long is my price locked in for when buying from APMEX?</h3>
    <p>
      Your price is locked in for 5 business days on orders under $25,000 (USD) and three 3 business days for orders more than $25,000 (USD). That is the time you have to make your payment to APMEX. Once you have placed an order with APMEX, you have entered into a binding agreement. When ordering online, the price at which your order is submitted is the locked in price. Your confirmation number will be on the final order screen and in your return email.

    <p>
      APMEX reserves the right to refuse an order when the confirmed price is incorrect, due to computer-related problems, pricing error or sudden movements in the precious metals market. Furthermore, we reserve the right to refuse or cancel any order deemed questionable, suspicious or of significant risk to APMEX regardless of payment method and price confirmation. You must ensure that your payment is dated within 24 hours and received by APMEX within five business days on orders under $25,000 (USD) and three business days on orders more than $25,000 (USD) to guarantee your price. Providing us with your credit card information is required to lock in pricing all orders. You are responsible to cover any market losses (Our Market Loss Policy) should your order be cancelled, in addition to a $35.00 (USD) cancellation fee.

  <div class="article-group" id="volumePricing">
    <h3>Does APMEX offer Volume Pricing on their products?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, but not on all products. Products with Volume pricing will display multiple quantities and different pricing per volume level. Volume pricing allows our customers to purchase a large quantity of one product at the best price available from the start of their order. The larger quantity ordered, the more a customer can save.
    </p>

  <div class="article-group" id="quantityDiscounts">
    <h3>Do you have quantity discounts?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. Our prices have already been calculated for high volume wholesale orders. However, APMEX will extend additional discounts when possible on orders more than $100,000 (USD) or large orders of individual items. Please feel free to call us with what you are looking for.

  <div class="article-group" id="discount">
    <h3>Is there a discount for paying by Check or Wire?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. We provide a 4.0% cash discount off our list/retail price to our customers if they pay for their orders by check, bank wire, cash or trade. The prices shown for each product on the website include the 4.0% cash discount unless you choose to pay by credit card or PayPal.
