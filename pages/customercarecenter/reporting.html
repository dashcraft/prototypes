    <h3>Why is this form required to be filed?</h3>
    <p>
      The 1099-B form is used to report any proceeds paid to a non-corporate seller to the IRS. This reporting enables the IRS to determine whether individuals who may be selling items as a source of income have properly reported the income from those sales on their tax returns. If you have additional questions, please consult a tax professional for details on your specific tax situation.
