  <div class="article-group" id="productsToBuy">
    <h3>What products do you buy?</h3>

  <div class="article-group" id="dontSendMetals">
    <h3>What happens if I don't send in the precious metals after a price has been confirmed?</h3>
    <p>
      Your transaction may be cancelled if you do not call by the end of the following business day with the registered mail or tracking number. Additionally, you will be liable to cover any market loss we incurred by accepting the order to buy from you. This is covered in our <a href="http://www.apmex.com/useragreement?market#marketLossPolicy">Market Loss Policy.</a> Furthermore, you will not be permitted to buy or sell to us in the future. If you call in with the registered mail or tracking number and we do not receive the items within 5 business days and the delay is due to the USPS, UPS or Federal Express, we will extend the deadline on a case by case basis.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="article-group" id="cancelOrder">
    <h3>Can I cancel my order?</h3>
    <p>
      Once we have issued a confirmation number, all prices are locked-in whether buying from us or selling to us. It is not our intention to enter into buying and/or selling transactions, accepting the risks involved only to have them cancelled. However, we realize rare situations happen where orders need to be cancelled. Should you elect to cancel and/or offset your order, you must do so during normal business hours of 9:00 – 5:00 EST 9 a.m. – 5 p.m. (ET) Monday – Friday. All cancellations are subject to our Market Loss Policy plus a $35.00 (USD) cancellation fee. Cancellations may only be approved over the telephone, at which time you will be given a cancellation number. At that time, if any market loss to APMEX has occurred, it will be calculated and added to the $35.00 (USD) cancellation fee. If applicable, you may elect to pay any market loss by credit card at that time or, we will invoice you in which you will have thirty days to pay the amount due in full. No future orders may be permitted until any market loss is paid in full. Any market gain on cancellations shall remain the property of APMEX.
