        <li>Credit Card, Bank Wire and PayPal Orders (containing Pre-33 Gold or Jewelry) - Ship within 2 business days following the date of confirmed payment.</li>
        <li>Credit Card, Bank Wire and PayPal Orders (not containing Pre-33 Gold or Jewelry) - Ship within 1 business day* following the date of confirmed payment.</li>
        <li>All Personal Check and eCheck Orders - Ship after a 4 business day holding period to verify funds. Additional holding days may be added if your bank delays confirmation of your check payment. Due to an increase in fraudulent activity, we no longer view bank/certified/cashier’s checks or money orders to be “as good as cash”. They are now also held for verification of funds.</li>

If this should happen, we reserve the right to delay delivery up to 30 days (From your expected shipping date) to fill your order. Even if the price continues to rise, your price is locked in. We will deliver your bullion (Non-Numismatic) product within 30 days.
